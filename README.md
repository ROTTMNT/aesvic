‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎  hello, and greetings！
please <i> whisper to interact </i> at all times as i am often offtab or elsewhere.  i tend to use busy to indicate my current status, that being ― busy = offtab , idle = online.  however, i apologize in advance if i blantantly ignore you if you are aiming for a conversation with me.  i do not enjoy socializing with people, more especially if we have nothing in common.  that being said, <i> aesvic, nortluca, subkit, and shadowpeach </i> fans are strongly encouraged to interact!  unless you're weird about them, otherwise, don't bother. <b> i also have lots of people hidden so if i'm ever sitting on someone please let me know... </b>

‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎  i am not an irl, nor am i a system.  i am always actively aware that i'm my own person, and i do not wish to be referred to as an irl or as a system because i am not either of those.  if you have issues with people taking names from fictional characters as their own, then it's best to not interact.  <i> joscarl, josvic, edvic, VALE, florimatt, and eddrew </i> are preferred to dni or avoid mentioning as well.  i just hate those pairing dynamics and i could list reasons why they wouldn't work out if you were to get upset by this...
