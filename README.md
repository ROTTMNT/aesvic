‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎  hello, and greetings！
whisper to interact at <i> all times, </i> as i rarely respond to public chats.  i'm often offtab or elsewhere, so if you'd like to chat, please... whisper.. please.  feel free to sit with me as well because i frankly just do not care about what you do to my virtual pixels as long as it's without any nsfw intentions.  i frequent the phighting, lmk, and the idv area the most.  i don't do well in certain social scenarios, but please don't be afraid to interact!!  that being said, <i> aesvic, nortluca, subkit, shadowpeach, and LMK </i> fans are strongly encouraged to interact.  unless you're weird about anyone or any media listed, otherwise don't bother.

‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎  i am not an irl, nor am i a system.  i am always actively aware that i'm my own person, and i do not wish to be referred to as an irl or as a system because i am not either of those.  if you have issues with people taking names from fictional characters as their own, then it's best to not interact.  <i> joscarl, josvic, edvic, VALE, florimatt, and eddrew </i> are preferred to dni or avoid mentioning as well.  ONLY FOLLOWING FRIENDSIES OR people i wouldn't mind being friends with, sorry follow 4 followers... you gotta talk 2 me first.  <i> plleaaaseee </i> sign my ata or straw as well, i enjoy seeing what people say or leave while i'm away.
