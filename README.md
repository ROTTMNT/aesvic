- ***idle/away*** is my main status on ponytown, so if you see me with it then i'm likely still there.  however, i do use busy often when i'm drawing or playing a different game. *PLEASE* w2i whenever im busy...
- *c+h* is completely fine with me and i think it's very silly, though don't be weird about it.  it's a pony game, it's not going to kill my family — however i'd rather not engage in activities with nsfw intent.  ***if i'm sitting with other people, i advise asking me first as often times my groups aren't open to it.***
- do keep in mind *i don't tend to enjoy social interactions unless we share a similar interest.*  so, i apologize if i come off as passive aggressive or rude in advance. though, i don't bite and i often try to treat most experiences with a mature mindset and attitude.

- ***people on my friendslist are usually always allowed to interact whenever unless stated otherwise*** *!* if i don't message you first then i'm more than likely scared off by you, however don't take that personally.
- i'm ***not*** an irl, and please do not refer to me as one.  i'm aware that i am my own person and i do just enjoy taking names from characters i find heavily relatable. (ie; aesop carl, norton campbell) I'M NOT A JOSCARLER EITHER, PLEASE STOP !!! you are allowed to like two characters seperately.

- ***if you want to interact, then please do.  it may be a pony game, however it genuinely confuses me whenever i see someone or one of my acquaintances staring at me for an unusual amount of time.***  *i don't bite !!* i do only enjoy interacting with those i share interests with.
- checking my rentry before interacting would be deeply appreciated as i do have a specified group that i don't wish to interact with.  leaving a kind message in my guestbook would be nice as well *!* ***if you see me engaging into any sort of arguemen, 90% of the time it's with my small group of friends and we're just messing around.***
